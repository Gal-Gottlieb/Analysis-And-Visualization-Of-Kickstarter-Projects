# Analysis And Visualization Of Kickstarter Projects

Data Analysis and visualization using Tableau and SQL for analyzing a data set from Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms.



A description of the data columns is included in the CSV file kickstarter_projects_data_dictionary in the zip file which is uploaded to the repository.



The project aims to help Mark, a venture partner at Sequoia Capital, better understand what makes a company successful in the future so the company can invest in successful companies.

The persona profile for Mark can be found in the repository in a PowerPoint file.



The following tools were used during project preparation:

1- Microsoft SQL Management Server (SSMS):

* Used for Data Cleaning and data management and integration (DMI)
* Used for Data Exploration
* Used to create more detailed tables outside of the existing ones by writing queries
A file containing the SQL script was uploaded to the repository

2- Tableau:

* Used for Data Exploration
* Used to create the data visualization
