# Analysis And Visualization Of Kickstarter Projects

A data analysis and visualization using Tableau and SQL of data from Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms.



A description of the data columns is included in the CSV file kickstarter_projects_data_dictionary in the zip file that is uploaded to the repository.



The purpose of the project is to help Mark, a venture partner at Sequoia Capital, understand which factors make an enterprise successful in the future, so that the company can invest in successful ventures.

There is a Power Point file in the repository that contains Mark's persona profile.




The following tools were used during project preparation:

1- Microsoft SQL Management Server (MSMS):

* Data Cleaning and data management and integration (DMI)
* Data exploration
* Used to create more detailed tables outside of the existing ones by using queries.
A file containing the SQL script was uploaded to the repository.

2- Tableau:

* Used to create the data visualization.
